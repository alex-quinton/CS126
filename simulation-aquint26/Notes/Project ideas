Main Idea: Project simulates the process of evolution

Each location is populated with animals that must mate in order to adapt to their environment
There are different types of animals that have different base stats, but over time they will evolve to suit their environment

Locations have several stats

humidity:     Dry --------------- Humid
temperature: Cold --------------- Hot
water:     little --------------- lots
plants:    barren --------------- lush
also have base survival chance stat

Every location has a rain() and disaster() method that modifies the stats of the location somewhat for the next epoch
e.x. decreases temperature in mountain, changes base survival odds

Every epoch, the chance of each animal surviving is calculated based on how well their traits suit the environment
The survivors then breed in order to produce another generation

The player is responsible for creating locations, and can add animals if they choose

People are another type of thing, and every epoch they have a chance of adopting an animal (guarantees survival)
or killing an animal(guarantees death). Every epoch, each human randomizes disposition, changing their odds of adopting/killing

Location types:
savanna-
-low humidity
-high temperature
-little water
-barren plants
chance of fire each epoch

Jungle-
-high humidity
-high temperature
-lots of water
-lush plants
chance to flood each epoch

Forest-
-medium humidity
-medium temperature
-medium water
-lush plants
chance of storm each epoch

Tundra-
-low humidity
-low temperature
-medium water
-medium plants
chance of blizzard each epoch

Class Structure:

Locations-
double-Humidity
double-Temperature
double-Water
double-Plants
ArrayList<Animal> animals: the animals in that location
function-nextEpoch: calls nextEpoch on all the animals
